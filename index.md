**My meme**

![](My_Meme2.png)

The places I found the images for this meme
* I saw the first image on social media while scrolling through an accounts feed
* The second image was messaged to me as a gif by a friend while we were texing

The second image was originally a gif that came from [tenor](https://tenor.com/) 

There were a few things that inspired me to make the meme that I did
1. Frustrations with having to do group work via zoom
2.  Wanting to use orginal images for my meme, rather than just using a combination of images that had already been done
3.  I just think the images are funny
